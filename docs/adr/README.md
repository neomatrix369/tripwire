# Architecture Decision Records

Formal ADRs for durable technology and boundary choices.

Planning-level decisions (slice waivers, priority, review skips, model split)
stay in [plan/DECISIONS.md](../plan/DECISIONS.md). Use an ADR when the choice
should outlive a single slice and constrain runtime topology, security, or
quality gates.

Status values: **Proposed**, **Accepted**, **Deprecated**, **Superseded**.

**0001** is **Proposed**, not Accepted: it records an intended Monk packaging /
deployment path that is **not implemented**. The supported Live path remains the
operator workstation flow. Records **0002** and above are Accepted.
